## Technologies

I used `React Native`, `React-Navigation`, `Redux`, `Redux-Thunk`, `React-Redux` and some more libraries - [explain just below](#)

- [React-native-fast-image](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-fast-image): Performant React Native image component.
- [react-native-video-player](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-video-player): This player uses react-native-video for the video playback. So We can also play mp4 GIF.I just added and comment some code so you can see my work.
  `NOTE- With this npm some libraries -- react-native-video react-native-vector-icons`--- Okay so obviously we imporve everything for now I used.
- [babel-plugin-module-resolver](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-module-resolver) : This plugin can simplify the require/import paths in your project. For example, instead of using complex relative paths like ` ../../../../utils/my-utils`, you can write `utils/my-utils`.

## Setup

- download or clone the [repository](https://github.com/ShravanMeena/pillow-apk.git)
- `npm install`
- run `npx react-native run-ios/android`

## ðŸš€ Approach

### Folder Struture:

![struture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ShravanMeena/pillow-apk/main/src/assets/images/folder_struture.png?token=GHSAT0AAAAAAB5K76VCATG2RFLQBP4FARKIY7JKG5Q)

### ðŸ¤˜ Code quality & consistency:

- In this project I use absolute path for import ([What is absolute path?](https://dev.to/abrahamlawson/using-absolute-paths-in-react-native-24ak))
- Helper function for managing common function like for showing error make a toast
- I try write clean and efficinte code (You can see [here](https://github.com/ShravanMeena/pillow-apk))
- For consistency I try to import everything proper way
- And try to use a `global function for api` call, we can call GET/POST/DELETE/PUT api with only same function without thinking error handling every api call

## ðŸ˜Ž Reusability

- So I have create reusbale components even title or heading
- apiAxiosHandler is the best reusable method, with help of this we can call api and get response and error hadling in same place
- for this i have create a proper `ui` folder so we can use them all over the code
